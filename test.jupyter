# Recommendation Engine Mini-Assignment

## Objective
Your task is to implement a basic recommendation engine that can match offers to users based on their profile.

## Dataset Synthesis
Create a small dataset for this assignment:

1. `user_profiles.csv`: Create a dataset containing user profile information with at least 100 users. Include attributes such as age, gender, and interests. Some examples of user credentials are:
   - "marathon runner"
   - "pottery fan"
   - "book worm"

2. `offers.csv`: Create a dataset containing information about at least 20 available offers. Include offer details and target audience information that can be matched with user profiles.

## Basic Recommendation Engine
1. Load and preprocess the `user_profiles.csv` and `offers.csv` datasets.
2. Implement a simple recommendation engine that matches offers to users based on their profile. You can use techniques such as content-based filtering or a rule-based approach.
3. Evaluate the performance of your recommendation engine using a suitable metric such as precision or recall.
4. Provide a brief report explaining your approach and the evaluation results.

## Bonus: Attribution to User Credentials
In a separate section of your report, describe in words how you would approach attributing the importance of each user credential in the matching process. Consider the following:
- How would you determine the impact of each user credential on the recommendation engine's output?
- What techniques or methods could be used to quantify the contribution of each credential?
- How would you interpret and communicate the results of the attribution analysis?

## Bonus: Privacy Preservation
In another section of your report, discuss how you would incorporate privacy preservation techniques into the recommendation engine. Address the following points:
- What privacy risks or concerns are associated with using user profile data in a recommendation system?
- What privacy preservation techniques could be applied to mitigate these risks?
- How would you balance the trade-off between privacy and recommendation quality?
- What steps would you take to ensure user data remains protected while still providing meaningful recommendations?

## Deliverables
1. A Jupyter notebook containing the code for data synthesis and the basic recommendation engine.
2. A report in PDF format documenting the following:
   - Your approach, methodology, and evaluation results for the basic recommendation engine.
   - A section discussing the attribution of user credentials (bonus).
   - A section discussing privacy preservation techniques (bonus).
3. The synthesized datasets used for training and evaluation.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Quality and relevance of the synthesized datasets
- Correctness and effectiveness of the basic recommendation engine
- Clarity and organization of the codebase
- Quality and completeness of the documentation and report
- Thoughtfulness and feasibility of the attribution and privacy preservation discussions (bonus)
